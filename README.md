## About Me:

As a Front End Web Developer I am passionate about combining my love of coding with my love of continued learning. With my UI/UX training and strong communication skills I produce beautiful and well thought out design work. With a positive attitude and strong growth mindset, I am self motivated and work well in groups. Empathy, persistence, curiosity and an obsession with details are my motivating factors when designing.
